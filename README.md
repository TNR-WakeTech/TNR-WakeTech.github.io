# About Me
## My Interests
* PC Gaming  
  I enjoy world building and construction/business management simulation games like _Cities Skylines_, _Crossroads Inn_, _Planet Zoo_, etc. I don't own or play any console games, though I do watch smaller YouTube gamer channels. 
* Reading  
 I like to read many different genres, including sci-fi (space colonies, dystopia), fantasy, biographies, horror, classic lit., cookbooks, world & U.S. history, etc. I prefer physical books whenever possible (I have an extensive home library), but I am grateful for subscription services like Amazon.com's [Kindle Unlimited.](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/bookshelf?gclid=Cj0KCQiA4rK8BhD7ARIsAFe5LXKdsNOSZpRyNniBOnXp7G_gJt-RJOy8nLZOalTKTd07V-7EKDiKhEwaAqmcEALw_wcB&ref=abpmku_24_4_us_psr_gs_r_mn_rbhab_rbw_rbw_aEcbqxOYNp_rbt1&shoppingPortalEnabled=true&shouldPandoraUseNewSlot=true&ccs_id=d6f6f38c-ae03-4e4f-9070-e8686ddcb77a)
## Websites I Recommend
* [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com)  
 For people who read as much as I do, Good Reads is excellent for book reviews and tracking books you've read which can lead to recommendations for similar books.
* [Grandbaby Cakes](https://grandbaby-cakes.com/)  
 This is an excellent recipe website if you like cooking flavorful cuisine influenced by the American south. There are over a 1,000 recipes for amazing meals, including desserts.
